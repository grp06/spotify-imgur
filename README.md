I built this app to learn how to connect 3rd party API's to React + Redux projects and deploy Webpack projects to Heroku.

### **Technologies used:**
- React
- Redux
- ES6
- Node
- Webpack
- Express
- Babel

Eventually I'd love to have like 20 buttons, each corresponding to a different API. Useless, **but awesome**
